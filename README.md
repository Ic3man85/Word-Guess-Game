# Word-Guess-Game

This game was a fun one, and still have alot i want to do with it. It was the first game that i made with javascript. It was a huge challenge, but was a great learning experience.

I decided to do the game on fly fishing. The game will randomly grab a word that has to do with fly fishing, you have 10 guesses to guess all the correct letters in the word. When you run out of guess's then the game will end and tell you "you lost and the word was blank", if you guess them all then you win and it will tell you "you won and the word was blank". It will track how many times that you have won the game, by guessing the word correctly. The game will keep going, and tracking your wins until you refresh the page.

Thanks for taking a look!! Feedback is great!
